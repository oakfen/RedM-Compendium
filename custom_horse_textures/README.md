This is the README associated for custom horse textures. 
All thoughts, notes, etc are associated in this file and will correlate to other files within this folder. 

All you need to do is restream the texture files for that designated horse. You edit them in photoshop, and need to export them. There are a few guides on the internet you can find that show how to correctly export these files. 

Some horses share texture files, which I've provided the pdf that is shared (credits to the owner - it is not my pdf) and you can reference which horse models share which textures, and which ones your server may want to replace. 

I highly recommend getting Codex, which is a tool that which allow you to view and download all of the raw files for every horse texture in the game. 

Steps to Load/Replace Custom Textures: 

1. Find your desired texture that you want to replace 
2. Locate the EDITED CUSTOM TEXTURE FILE that you have downloaded, comissioned, or made. 
3. Rename the EDITED CUSTOM TEXTURE FILE to the ONE YOU'RE WANTING TO REPLACE. 
4. Place in a [custom] folder, with an fxmanifest
5. Restart server.
