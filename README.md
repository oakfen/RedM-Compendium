This knowledge is all for the modded client RedM under CFX. It is a modded client of RDR2.

Topics range from: 
- YMT files
- YTD/texture files
- Creating your own custom horse models
- Creating your own custom coat textures for horse peds
- Using Codex to find texture files
- Native research/use cases

- All of this was founded by me, Mei aka oakfen - former Head Developer for The Tackroom and the creator of the "Oakfen x KD Stable Update." This information existed before I found it, I am just compiling all of my knowledge into this github
